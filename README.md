w# Dalamud Plugins
contains manually assembled packages for a couple plugins i havce either modified for personal use or ones i may build versions of myself for funsies or any arbitrary reason

nothing here is necessarily kept up to date with the current released version of it's official source, i'm not really a programmer but i do like to tinker; so, basically , don't use these builds over any others under almost any circumstances. if an update breaks something here, i almost definitely have no idea how to help or fix it.

for this reason i'ma not going to bother filling in any instructions for using this repository, it's here mainlay for my own convenienece and using it will likely be super inconvenient for others

if i ever make a usefuil change to someting here i'll get it pushed upstream asap, otehrwise consider these broken by default or something, i even half-assed this readme
